                            <br> I am an emerging clinical analyst with a passion for storytelling. I believe that <strong> information and data are the two most powerful tools to change the world. </strong>
                            <br><br>
							Currently I work as an Occupational Health and Safety Specialist at Pivot Onsite Innovations.
							While I enjoy my current position and the patient care and safety I have given. 
							I'm prepared to direct my focus toward the health information technology industry and put what I've learned in the Health Informatics program to use in a challenging new position.
							<br><br>
							I spend the most of my time looking at a computer screen. 
							When I am free, I typically spend my time programming and trying to glean knowledge from huge datasets. 
							<strong>Data analysis, visualization, and machine learning are some of my strengths.</strong>
							I've gotten really good learning quickly and fixing problems. 
							I like a challenge now and then; the making of this website was definitely a big one because frontend programming languages aren't my strong suit.
							I frequently work on end-to-end data science projects that mostly include the use of Python.
							I take a break at night to either enjoy the company of my friends on Slack while playing League of Legends or go to the gym.
                            <br><br>
							In the part where I showcase my portfolio, you can look some of my projects. 
							If you want to download and experiment with my code, feel free to do so because I linked the GitHub repositories. 
							My education has largely been traditional. 
							I received my B.S in Biomedical Informatics at CUNY NYCCT and will receive my M.S in Medical Informatics 2023. 
							I have also spent numerous hours on websites like Percipio/Skillsoft and FreeCodeCamp, downloaded e-books, and attended courses on Coursera. 
							I am appreciative of online educators for democratizing education and providing me with the chance to always learn new things and improve on things that I don't really have a grasp on.
